#### Description:
As my final project, I made a web application that helps RPG player create their character sheets

I used the react library and as consequence I used JavaScript, HTML and CSS. For the last part I used a library called pdf-lib to manipulate the pdf with react.

My project is based on seven webpages that asks the user to input information and press interactive and responsible buttons that creates variables through the code.

It helps the user with some interactive explanation of how each step works.

When the user finishes all the character information needed, a character sheet pdf file filled with all the character information gathered through the steps becomes available for the user to download or print. 

The design choises were all decided to make the webapp have a mistery/horror feeling, as the RPG system has it too. All the colors were decided based on the same pallete, making the design part harmonious.

This project was made becouse creating a character in any of RPG systems usually takes a lot of time and is really hard to understant the rulling behind it, so this web application was made to make this process easier and faster, with friendly interfaces, interactive buttons and harmonious colors.

The files contained in the pages folder are all the pages found in the project, they are in a separated folder to make it easier to understand the project. All the image files were saved inside the Images folder becouse of the same reason. All the files found inside the components folder are the components used inside the pages, as the react library helps you separate your code in components. So all the popups, all the tables and some buttons became components to help the code get cleaner and help with some aditional features too, as you can pass children props to or from the components.
